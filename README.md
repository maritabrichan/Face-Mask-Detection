# Face Mask Detection Using MobileNetV2

Wearing masks has been proven to be the most effective way to prevent any further spread of the COVID-19 virus since this pandemic has started, so we have decided to implement
a face mask detection system in order to help make sure that everyone wears their masks.\
\
This face mask detection system was implemented using the Convolutional Neural Network MobileNetV2, 
the deep learning framework of Keras and transfer learning techniques.
